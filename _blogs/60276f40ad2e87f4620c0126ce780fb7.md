title: How to clone system to smaller disk/SD card on Raspberry Pi
excerpt: "How to clone system to a smaller hard drive or SD card on Raspberry Pi, including partition, set up and repair boot files."
---
Recently, an old solid-state drive is free. Although the writing speed is not fast, it is enough to meet the Gigabit network, so I want to replace the solid-state drive currently used for the Raspberry Pi. Due to new system need to set somethings, so I don't plan to reinstall the system. In addition, this old disk is 120GB, which is smaller than the current drive (512GB), so some common methods of copying hard drives cannot be used.

This article only requires the use of Raspberry Pi, but I use SSH to access the Raspberry Pi, so the screenshots will be in macOS style.

**After writing the article, I did it again and confirmed that there was no problem, but I still recommend readers to back up important files first, just in case.**

This blog is long and the operation is also cumbersome, so I make a script for use: [https://github.com/ZhongUncle/clone_rasp_disk](https://github.com/ZhongUncle/clone_rasp_disk)

## Notice
Due to verifying this process repeatedly, so I re-format and re-sync to disk. and I encountered a problem: Since formatting does not clear all existing files, `rysnc` may be not synchronizing correctly or partitions' setting is not set correctly, so the boot flow will be broken. 

To avoid this problem, there are two ways:
- you can just overwrite the first 5GB partition of disk with "0" (use `dd`) , it will cover the boot partition and some directories of system, so its size due to your installation and settings.
- Completely erase the entire disk. It will takes more time, but it can ensure no problems.

## Why not use `dd` or SD card copier
This article will not use the CLI program `dd` or the GUI application SD card copier.

Do not use `dd` because when these programs copy, they copy the entire disk, which will cause the write to definitely fail (the target disk is smaller than the destination disk). And the speed is very slow. Even if we try to reduce the number of controllers that the transmission passes through and improve the transmission interface, writing from solid state to solid state is only 30~45MB/s (15~20MB/s without any optimization).

But SD card copier does not have this problem. I don't want to plug in HDMI cable to back of monitor, and it’s not suitable for daily backup and other operations, so I want to study how to use the CLI. **If you can use desktop mode, it is recommended to use the SD card copier application directly**. Moreover, this method is much faster, and the speed can be stable at 50~70MB/s.

## Principle
The method in this article is the same as the principle of SD card copier: first divide the target hard disk into two areas, the boot area (named `bootfs`, format Windows_FAT_32) and the usage area (also called the root area named `rootfs` , the format is Linux), and then use `rsync` to copy, which is much faster.

If you use lsblk -f on the Raspberry Pi (this is just for demonstration, a more detailed tool will be introduced later) to view the structure and file system of the hard disk, you can see:

![Structure of hard disk file system](/assets/images/ecee33f3cf6a4b3fa0abe9abfe78a02f.png)

>If you are curious about why the Raspberry Pi's boot partition `bootfs` does not use the ext4 file system, this is because the minimum requirement is 16 GiB, but the boot area is a bit outrageous. In addition, using FAT32, a file system that can be read on Windows, Linux, and macOS, is also convenient for changing some settings (the Raspberry Pi can modify some configurations, such as HDMI levels, by modifying the files in the boot area `bootfs` wait).

Due to startup requirements, we need partitions to exist on the hard disk in the order of "boot area - usage area". So we need to format the startup area first, and then format the remaining part into the use area.

## Step 1: Partition and create a new file system
First connect the two disks to the Raspberry Pi. Remember to format the target hard disk into a file system that Linux can recognize (on a Mac, you can use Disk Utility to format it as exFAT, or use Raspberry Pi Imager to format it as FAT32).

Next, use the `parted` tool to partition, not because it can be interactively operated, but mainly because it can display more detailed partition information, and it is more convenient to set some parameters.

First use the `sudo parted -l` command to obtain the currently connected hard disk information:

![Hard disk information printed by sudo parted -l](/assets/images/d4fef5475d5046ed9c46dc222cf6d5f9.png)

The first part is the system disk, where we can see the size, starting address, ending address, file system and other information of each partition. The second part is our target hard drive.

Then we use the following command to generate a similar partition structure on the target hard disk:

```
sudo parted /dev/sdb --script 'mklabel msdos mkpart primary fat32 4194.5kB 541MB mkpart primary ext4 541MB 120GB print quit'
```

- `/dev/sdb` is the device name of the target disk. Do not use `/dev/sdb1`, which is the name of an existing partition.
- Using `--script` will not enter interactive mode, so one command can complete the operation. It should be noted that this option is not officially used, but if you follow the above content and do not use this option and directly follow the following commands, the entire hard disk partition will be destroyed (there will be a prompt).
- `mklabel msdos` sets the partition mode to MBR format. `gpt` is not used here because the system is `msdos` (you can see this information from the `Partition Table` in the picture above).
- `mkpart primary fat32 4194.5kB 541MB `This part is the command to divide the boot area. `primary` means an independent partition (or called "primary partition", which corresponds to "extended partition"). Use the `fat32` file system, and use `4194.5kB` as the starting address, because the Raspberry Pi starts from block 8192, but the value displayed by `parted` is incorrect, as shown in `sudo fdisk -l` The content shall prevail. The termination address is the same as the termination address of the system disk.
- `mkpart primary ext4 541MB 120GB` This part is the command to divide the root area. Using the `ext4` file system, the starting address is the ending address of the boot area, but the ending address is the size of the hard disk, which is the same as shown in the original picture. The termination address is the same.
- `print` will print out partition information.
- `exit` will exit `parted`.

>It should be noted that this command cannot be split into two, because using `mkpart` after exiting will erase the original partition, so that one partition will be generated in the end.

Displayed as follows:

![Only one partition](/assets/images/21a91be015f5481faed8c6ee3d47af74.png)

At this time, the work has not been completed. We need to manually create the `FAT32` and `ext4` file systems for the two partitions, as follows:

```
sudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdb1
sudo mkfs.ext4 -L rootfs /dev/sdb2
```

If you don't do this step, some weird problems will occur. The previous partition information correctly shows that we have created a partition for `ext4`, numbered `2`. But if you check it with `sudo parted -l`, you will find the following situation. In the `File system` column, the second partition does not have any information:

![No information for the second partition](/assets/images/860376eeca0a4556be735cfa33fc7935.png)

At this time, when loading this partition, the following error message will be prompted:

```
$ sudo mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/rootfs/
mount: /mnt/rootfs: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb2, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.
        dmesg(1) may have more information after failed mount system call.
mount: (hint) your fstab has been modified, but systemd still uses
        the old version; use 'systemctl daemon-reload' to reload.
```

So create it manually.

## Part 2: Copy using `rsync`

Before using `rsync` to copy, the two partitions need to be loaded.

First, create a new directory under the `/mnt/` directory to mount the root partition:

```
sudo mkdir /mnt/rootfs
```

Then mount the root partition:

```
sudo mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/rootfs/
```

So where to copy (synchronize) to? Do you still remember the content in the first picture of the article? The directories corresponding to the two partitions on the system disk are displayed: `/boot/firmware` (boot partition) and `/` (root partition).

First is the boot partition:

```
sudo rsync -axHAWXS --numeric-ids --info=progress2 --exclude={"/mnt/","/boot/firmware/"} /* /mnt/rootfs
```

The options here mean the following:
- `a` is the archive mode, which will read the directory recursively without destroying symbolic links, permissions and other information.
- `x` means that file system boundaries will not be crossed.
- `H` preserves hard links.
- `A` preserves ACLs (Access Control Lists).
- `W` disables the incremental algorithm used by network transfers. Since these are all local paths, the speed can be increased.
- `S` can handle sparse files efficiently so that they take up less space after transfer. (Without this, all source files may be 8GB, but the total destination files may be 10GB)
- `numeric-ids` uses numeric IDs instead of mappings.
- `info=progress2` will display the transfer progress and information, and the progress and information of the entire transfer, rather than the statistical information of each file.
- There are several directories that do not need to be copied because they are duplicates, so use `--exclude=` to exclude them. In many articles about system cloning, other directories `/dev`, `/sys`, `/proc` are listed that can be ignored, but after I spent two hours rescuing, I can confirm that directories like `/dev` , `/sys`, `/proc` cannot be ignored (if I write a blog about how to rescue, I will list the link here)

Here is an explanation of the two excluded directories.
- The first `/mnt/` is to avoid repeated copying, because this is the destination of the copy. Otherwise it will be copied twice or more.
- The last `/boot/firmware/` is because this part is the startup content, we will copy it separately later (copying it together may skip this part).

A bunch of errors will be prompted when copying some files in the `/sys/` directory. Don't worry about these errors, because they cannot be read (show no permission) or are virtual files. For details, please read this post: [Why does rsync fail to copy files from /sys in Linux? - Unix & Linux stackexchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/73569/why-does-rsync-fail -to-copy-files-from-sys-in-linux/73610#73610)

Since some directories were excluded earlier, they need to be created manually here:

```
sudo mkdir /mnt/rootfs/mnt /mnt/rootfs/boot/firmware
```

Then you can mount the boot partition:

```
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/rootfs/boot/firmware/
```

Then copy the boot partition. Most of the options here are the same as those in the boot partition:

```
sudo rsync -axHAWXS --numeric-ids --info=progress2 /boot/firmware/* /mnt/rootfs/boot/firmware/
```

If you are more careful, you will find that the original red soft link file has now turned blue:

![red symbolic linked files to blue](/assets/images/06b906ea989c4dd7ae207f51878acc96.png)

You can rely on this phenomenon to determine whether the copy is successful. But not all files can be judged in this way. For example, some soft link files in `/proc/` may need to be automatically updated and generated later to turn red.

## Step 3: Repair `/etc/fstab` and `/boot/cmdline.txt`
The `/etc/fstab` file lists all disk partitions that are automatically mounted at startup. Since we copied it directly, the UUID does not match, so it needs to be modified manually.

Use `sudo fdisk -l` to see the identifier of the hard disk in the `Disk identifier` section, which we will need later:

![Disk identifier](/assets/images/7e2c4862fbc34f0b9cae562a560de638.png)

You can see the UUIDs of the two partitions `/dev/sdb1` and `/dev/sdb2`. Modify the corresponding file based on this content. **It should be noted that the modified file is `/mnt/rootfs/etc/fstab` (the path may be different)**, not `/etc/fstab in the system disk `.

Just change the two `PARTUUID=` in `/mnt/rootfs/etc/fstab` to the corresponding content, as follows (the picture below is unmodified, it stands to reason that only the last number of the two UUIDs is different):

![UUID](/assets/images/7ec8188eb2514545bf35eb6d78b06cf0.png)

Then modify the corresponding part in `/mnt/rootfs/boot/cmdline.txt` (this is a soft link, the actual file is in `firmware`) (the highlighted part in the figure below):

![Modify UUID part](/assets/images/a8e3418c8df54904b44058cfb6075220.png)

At this point everything is done. We can shut down the computer, unplug the original hard drive and try to start it up (be sure to unplug the old one, otherwise the old boot partition may be used to start the new one. I encountered this during the experiment, and then rescued the hard drive again) .

You can see that it can be used directly, with almost no difference. Use `sudo fdisk -l` to view the hard disk and you can see that the current `/dev/sda` is this hard disk.

Hope it can help those in need~
